Standardised difference scores (Cohen's ds) were then produced for each statement and the pooled ratings of the other three. Finally, for each group of four statements, a difference score was calculated between the statement with the largest ES and the sum of the other three ESs. The confidence interval refers to the 99% CI on the highest CI only, and the zero score therefore represents the sum of the other three ES. This value therefore represents the most non-reversible and unidirectional statement in each group, and allows one to rank these statements for their relative non-reversibility and uni-directionality. If confidence interval does not include zero AND effect size is positive, the statement's causality is both unidirectional and non-reversible, and is superior to the sum of the other three statements in the stimulus group. Such statements may be useful when uncontroversial, irreversible, and unidirectional causality statements are needed.
